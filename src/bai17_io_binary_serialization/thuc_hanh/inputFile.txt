General David Petraeus, the US former commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, told Sky News that "time will tell" whether the US and UK military will again have to be deployed.

The Taliban's swift capture of Afghanistan, following the final pull-out of western troops, has been a "tragic, heartbreaking and quite disastrous outcome", Gen Petraeus said.

The former CIA director said he understood there had been some "pretty significant warnings" by US military and intelligence officials about the extremist group's ability to retake control of the country prior to their dramatic capture.
